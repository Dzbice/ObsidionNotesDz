Personal Reflection: 

Ignoring the fact that we messed up collecting data because we didn’t record everything the first attempt, and how the beginning of the graphs look, I found the lab not the most difficult thing. I personally think the curves look like integrals to a degree at least. It’s not surprising that the graphs look so similar when you look at the mathematical relationship between them all, which is neat to some degree.

1. I wouldn’t be able to describe what other curves they look like since I don’t recognize any curve like them in the first place. A graph with an asymptote at 0 and some other number x away perhaps, but I don’t know any myself. 
    
2. Once the battery reaches around .5 Volts, all its values start to nosedive, which indicates that the battery has been discharged and it’s essentially dead.
$$\begin{align*}
	&P_{total} = I_{total} \Delta V_{total} = I_{total}^2R_{total}\\
	&P_{part} = I_{part} \Delta V_{part} = I^2_{part}R_{part}\\ 
	&P_{dissipated} = \frac{P_{part}}{P_{total}} * 100 \\ \\ 
	Ex: \\
	&P_{total} = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{1.2^2}{1.95} = 

\end{align*}$$
