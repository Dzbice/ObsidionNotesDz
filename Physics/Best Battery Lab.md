Personal Reflection: 

Ignoring the fact that we messed up collecting data because we didn’t record everything the first attempt, and how the beginning of the graphs look, I found the lab not the most difficult thing. I personally think the curves look like integrals to a degree at least. It’s not surprising that the graphs look so similar when you look at the mathematical relationship between them all, which is neat to some degree. The price of batteries, is insane. 

  
  

## Abstract: 

  In this lab the goal was to figure out the amount of power and energy held inside several types of batteries. The battery was initially short circuited to find its internal resistance, and then it was set with two resistors and voltage as well as current were recorded. Power was graphed in addition to these. A notable problem is that the fact that the Amp meter was measuring 1/10th of the total current wasn't accounted for in anything, so data is likely highly incorrect, but the methods used may be better suited for replication.

1. I wouldn’t be able to describe what other curves they look like since I don’t recognize any curve like them in the first place. I do think the graphs look like x^3 graphs though
    
2. Once the battery reaches around .5 Volts, all its values start to nosedive, which indicates that the battery has been discharged and it’s essentially dead.

4. Power Dispersion for individual parts was never measured so no direct comparison can be made.

Using this to find Energy
$\int_0^{2475} at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d \, dt = (\frac{a}{4}t^4 + \frac{b}{3}t^3 + \frac{1}{2}ct + dt)|^{2475}_0 = 296J$

The published duracell value is 14310 Joules, so we did something very incorrect somewhere. 
The double AA batteries have 2650 milliAmp hours. 
Looking at a discounted 16pack, it's dollar per battery.
