# Basic Tile Efficiency
## Mahjong Basics
Number tiles: 
- tanyao(simple): 2-8
- terminal: 1 and 9 
Honor Tiles: 
- Dragons
- Winds
Need 4 mentsu(groups) and 1 atama(head) i.e 4 set/sequences and 1 pair(for the most part)
Set: 3 identical tiles
Sequences: set of 3 consecutive tiles
Ready = tenpai
~ shanten: ~ tiles away from tenpai

**Advancing hand**: reduce the shanten until tenpai basically. Think of 2-1 not 3-0

**Protorun**: A sequence that needs one tile to be finished
- Side Wait/ ryanmen: ex: 3 man 4 man: 8 tiles wait(2 or 3)
- Closed wait/kanchan: ex: 2 man 4 man: 4 wait(3)
- Edge wait/penchan: ex: 8 sou 9 sou: 1 wait(7)
Kanchan are better then penchan since they can become ryanmen easier

Side wait> closed wait> edge wait
 3-7 tiles > 2, 8> 1,9, honor tiles

kanchan versatility
35,46,57 > 13,24,68,79

toitsu(pair)
can be head, protoset, component of chiitoitsu(7 pairs)
Missing head isn't that bad since it's usually able to be made easily

Toitsu: 
- 1: no the most useful since 
	- drawing another of the tile loses head
	- drawing another of the tile isn't that likely
- 2: Most useful amount to have
	- Drawing either of the tiles will give a run and inform on pair
- 3: just lest efficient, easily leads to net negative waits if taking it
- 4: can go chiitoitsu so .. yeah
2>1,4>3

With open hand, if intending for pon, 3 pairs is better tho
perfect ishanten:
2 ryanmen, 2 toitsu
perfect nishanten
3 ryanmen, 3 pairs
### Complex Shapes
Anything that doesn't constitutes on the tile blocks is a floating tile
#### 3 tile complex
ryankan - Double kanchan i.e 3 5 7, can make ryanmans and full wait
- 5 diff patterns: 135,246,357,468,579
- 2 wait on all of them. twice as much than normal kanchan
- can sometimes be hidden so look to spot. 
- useful when nishanten or worse. don't rely on too much
Protorun + 1: - a proto run with a toirsu in it
-
