# Basic Tile Efficiency
## Mahjong Basics
Number tiles: 
- tanyao(simple): 2-8
- terminal: 1 and 9 
Honor Tiles: 
- Dragons
- Winds
Need 4 mentsu(groups) and 1 atama(head) i.e 4 set/sequences and 1 pair(for the most part)
Set: 3 identical tiles
Sequences: set of 3 consecutive tiles
Ready = tenpai
~ shanten: ~ tiles away from tenpai

**Advancing hand**: reduce the shanten until tenpai basically. Think of 2-1 not 3-0

**Protorun**: A sequence that needs one tile to be finished
- Side Wait/ ryanmen: ex: 3 man 4 man: 8 tiles wait(2 or 3)
- Closed wait/kanchan: ex: 2 man 4 man: 4 wait(3)
- Edge wait/penchan: ex: 8 sou 9 sou: 1 wait(7)
Kanchan are better then penchan since they can become ryanmen easier

Side wait> closed wait> edge wait
 3-7 tiles > 2, 8> 1,9, honor tiles

kanchan versatility
35,46,57 > 13,24,68,79

toitsu(pair)
can be head, protoset, component of chiitoitsu(7 pairs)
Missing head isn't that bad since it's usually able to be made easily

Toitsu: 
- 1: no the most useful since 
	- drawing another of the tile loses head
	- drawing another of the tile isn't that likely
- 2: Most useful amount to have
	- Drawing either of the tiles will give a run and inform on pair
- 3: just lest efficient, easily leads to net negative waits if taking it
- 4: can go chiitoitsu so .. yeah
2>1,4>3

With open hand, if intending for pon, 3 pairs is better tho
perfect ishanten:
2 ryanmen, 2 toitsu
perfect nishanten
3 ryanmen, 3 pairs
### Complex Shapes
Anything that doesn't constitutes on the tile blocks is a floating tile
#### 3 tile complex
ryankan - Double kanchan i.e 3 5 7, can make ryanmans and full wait
- 5 diff patterns: 135,246,357,468,579
- 2 wait on all of them. twice as much than normal kanchan
- can sometimes be hidden so look to spot. 
- useful when nishanten or worse. don't rely on too much
Protorun + 1: - a proto run with a toitsu in it
- breaking these can be... inefficient
- if u have to, break the weakest one first. 
#### 4 Tile complex shapes
Nobetan- stetched single: 4 consecutive tile
- useful when in tenpai and ishanten
- can be used as run and head candidates
- can produce two runs
- 6 patterns
	- 1234: 6 wait total
	- 2345: 7 wait total
	- 3456: 8 wait total
	- 4567: 8 wait total
	- 5678: 7 wait total
	- 6789: 6 wait total
- 3456 and 4567 are most versatile. 
- try to keep basically
Nakabukure - Buldging float: floating tile in middle of a run
- good at making ryanmen waits
- ex: 3445, drawing 2356 makes one
- consider 3M 4M 4M 5M 4P 6P 8P 8P 1S 3S 5S 5S 6S 8S
	- discarding 4M and breaking nakabukure non ideal
	- can discard 8S to maintain it
	- Henry thoughts: 
		- it depends, drawing a 2m nets the most points
		- optimally would discard 4m, draw 2m, discard N and have a 2,5M wait. If draw 5M, sanshoku which extra han. Don't riichi apparently
- When in tenpai, usually would rather have something else
- So keep till like ishanten ig

### Waits
5 basic wait patterns
- ryanmen: 34: 2,5: 2 kinds, 8 tiles
- shanpon(dual pon): 3355:3,5: 2 kinds, 4 tiles
- kanchan: 68: 7, 1 kind 4 tiles
- penchan: 12: 3: 1 kind 4 tiles
- tanki: 2: 2: 1 kind, 3 tiles

yeah uh ryanmen good, tanki can change so it's versatile, the others not as good

Stretched Single Wait + Semi Side wait
Stretched single: 2345: 25 wait
Semi side: 3345: 3-6 wait

## 5 block method
#### Locate A redundant tile
Consider (5m 5m) (7m 8m) (2p 4p 5p 5p) (1s 3s 3s) (r r r) 
Can be considered to have 5 blocks, unknown 4 runs or head yet. 
1s is useful in it's block since it grants another wait, 2p is useless since the block already take 3p 
The other blocks aren't considered as they are self sufficient

Don't make any block too weak
Blocks should have at most 3 tiles

## Pursuing Yaku
### Sanshoku
Mixed triple sequence
#### Floating

# Scoring
打点: (daten): hand value
3 steps: 
1. Count han
	1. Figure out how many han you have
	2. If 5 or more han, go to step 3
2. Figure out how many fu you have
	1. 4 or less han fu is needed
3. Scored
	1. ... get the score
## Counting Han
Need to be able to identify all yaku, and how much han for each. 
8000 is the most important thing to know(mangan ron, non dealer)
haneman = 1.5 mangan
baiman = 2 mangan
sanbaiman.. 3 mangan
yakuman = 4 mangan
Dealer scores are 1.5 non dealer scores
| Han   | Name      | Ron (Non-dealer) | Ron (Dealer) | Tsumo (Non-dealer) | Tsumo (Dealer) |
|-------|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 5     | mangan    | 8000             | 12000         | 2000-4000           | 4000-all        |
| 6–7   | haneman   | 12000            | 18000         | 3000-6000           | 6000-all        |
| 8–10  | baiman    | 16000            | 24000         | 4000-8000           | 8000-all        |
| 11–12 | sanbaiman | 24000            | 36000         | 6000-12000          | 12000-all       |
| 13+*  | yakuman   | 32000            | 48000         | 8000-16000          | 16000-all       |

## Figuring out fu or wtv
Shortcut: 
- Chiitoitsu = 25
- 1 or more quad = kys
- toitoi(all triplets) = 40
- Pinfu
	- ron = 30
	- tsumo = 20 
- closed without pinfu
	- ron ~40 
	- tsumo ~ 30
- open hand : ~30 

# Defense
Consider if hand is in tenpai, how good potential hand is, how good opponent hand may have etc. 
Can't do all this in limited time ofc

When someone else in tenpai:
- Offense(2 mor more conditions)
	- Tenpai
	- HIgh scoring
	- good wait
- Fold(two or more conditions)
	- ishanten or worse
	- bad wait
	- low scoring
How to tell if someone is in tenpai
3 main possibilities: 
- Riichi..duh
- open tenpai
- Closed tnepai and didn't call tenpai .... i.e dama... ignore this shi for now i ain't doin that

High scoring means you need 7700 points at least(5200 if no red 5)
fun fact. dual pon, kanchan, penchan, and single are bad waits... so yeah

... 
## How to fold?
